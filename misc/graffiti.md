## Summary

![Graffiti System](./img/graffiti-overview.png)
The graffiti system was introduced in Version 2.5 as an addition to the lineup of features for illegal factions. It is an enhanced version to the former tag system, which was introduced in Version 2.4, and later disabled in Version 2.4 R2.

The development of the graffiti system started in mid-2014, but its implementation had to be postponed multiple times due to unforeseen circumstances. After two years of consideration, the development team introduced a basic 'tag' system in Version 2.4, where players were allowed to place a descriptive text label at any location around the map. Unfortunately, the system was disabled in Version 2.4 R2 due to multiple incidents of misusing the system.

With the system making a return in Version 2.5, it has been decided to keep this feature exclusive to official illegal factions in order to moderate the number of graffiti placed around the server. This feature was scripted using basic resources that is available from San Andreas Multiplayer.

## Core Feautures

The graffiti system allow players from official illegal factions to attach text on any location. You will also need to have a spray can in your possession, which can be purchased at any general shop.

To add a graffiti, stand in front of a wall and equip your spray can. Once ready, use the '/tag' command to trigger a dialog box, where you will be given various options to design your graffiti. These options are as follows:

- Tag Object - This option allows you to set the size (object) of the graffiti. Each option varies by size.
- Tag Text - This option allows you to input the tag that will appear in the graffiti. You can use ~n~ to insert a line break between your graffiti text.
- Tag Font - This option allows you to choose the font of your graffiti.
- Tag Text Size - This options allows you to choose the size of your graffiti text. The size ranges between 1 to 255.
- Tag Text Color - This option allows you to choose a text color from the default color choices. You can also customize it by indicating your preferred color in RGB format.
- Tag Text Bold - This option will make your graffiti text bold. Choosing the option again will disable the boldness of the text.
